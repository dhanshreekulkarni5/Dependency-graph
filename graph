In mathematics, computer science and digital electronics, a dependency graph is a directed graph representing dependencies of several objects towards each other. 
It is possible to derive an evaluation order or the absence of an evaluation order that respects the given dependencies from the dependency graph.
A dependency graph is a graph that represents dependencies between objects of some application domain. 
They are direc- ted graphs. Relations between nodes usually represent some form of dependency between objects. Let the nodes repre- sent packages of a software system. 
The Dependency diagrams feature of ApexSQL Analyze, besides having the ability to convey database dependencies graphically.
it also allows users to customize and design the overall appearance of the dependency diagram, in order to improve its visual look and readability.
